# Delay Embedded Regressive Reduced Order Model (derrom)

derrom is a Delay Embedded Regressive Reduced Order Model. It provides a modular package, which is designed to perform computationally efficient regression on high-dimensional time-series data. The model is trained with the supervised learning paradigm, where a set of existing input-output pairs is used to optimize the model parameters to obtain the desired regression performance.

The library reference can be found [[here](https://derrom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)]

A number of examples, which apply derrom to the forecasting of nonlinear solid-state transient dyanamics, are provided [[here](https://github.com/stmeinecke/derrom/tree/main/examples)]
